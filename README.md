# FAR-HAN-NEWS

This project is a news application built during my software development course at Northcoders. The data is for demonstration purposes and has been provided to me.
I previously built the API and now have built a web application in the front end. 

I wanted this application to have the feel of a conventional news website, as well as to practice the many things I have learned on the Northcoders course. 

Users need to log in access more features of the website, however, this is using context so does not maintain the state on a refresh.

You can find the deployed website here: 
https://far-han-news.netlify.app/
