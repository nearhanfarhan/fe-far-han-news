Stories I want to add still

-vote on articles with rendering x
-comment on articles with optimisitc rendering ~
-need to log in to post comments x
-delete comments by logged in user x
-delete articles by logged in user 
-post articles with new topic
-Fix how optimistically rendered comments handle added likes -(maybe make it that it depends on who is logged in?) - fixed for likes but new comments have a delete button which does not work....
- add topics as a component of articles view (maybe a drop down?)
